''' 
Use professional astronomy libraries to query a star catalog
for bright stars and place glowstone at their true, observed positions within 
minecraft based on the time/location specified.

NOTE: The distances/brightnesses are not to scale. 

NOTE 2: astroquery is not a mcppy dependency, but required here. 
You must install astroquery separately:

pip install astroquery
